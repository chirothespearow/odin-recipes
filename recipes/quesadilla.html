    <p>This is an easy way to serve up a quick dinner with a lot of flavor! No need to use oil or butter to toast each side of the quesadilla,
     but you can if you'd like. I prefer a dry heat. Tortillas made with a corn-flour mixture work best. Serve with either Buffalo sauce, 
     ranch dressing, or sour cream!</p>

    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>

        <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>1 shallot, diced</li>

        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>

        <li>¼ cup ranch dressing</li>

        <li>⅛ cup Buffalo sauce</li>

        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>½ (1 inch) cube shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>

        <li>½ cup shredded Gouda cheese</li>

        <li>8 (6 inch) tortillas, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken tenders into a medium-sized pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer until chicken tenders are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain chicken tenders. Transfer to a cutting board and cut or shred as desired.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook shallot until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, ranch dressing, Buffalo sauce, and cooked shallots in a bowl; mix until creamy. Add cooked chicken and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread Buffalo chicken mixture onto a tortilla and top with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and Gouda cheese. Cover with a second tortilla and set quesadilla aside. Repeat with remaining tortillas, chicken mixture, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 quesadilla and cook until browned on 1 side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until tortilla is crisp and cheese is melted, about 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining quesadillas.</li>
    </ol>
